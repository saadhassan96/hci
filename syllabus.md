## Course Summary
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a rapidly expanding field of research and development that continues to transform how we use computers over the past five decades. This course is designed for both graduate and undergraduate students interested in understanding fundamental HCI theories, techniques, and research methods. The course covers various topics, including human factors (perception and cognition) in computing, graphical design fundamentals, qualitative and quantitative user research methods, interaction modeling, prototyping, and evaluations. The course also briefly reviews emerging areas in HCI research, including human-AI interaction, accessible computing, ubiquitous computing, and augmented reality. Both undergraduate and graduate students will work on semester-long projects.

## Course Credits
**Credits:** 3  
**Pre-requisites/Co-requisites:** None

## Course Learning Objectives
- Conduct user research (interviews, focus groups, contextual inquiries, surveys) within real-world contexts to grasp the aspirations, goals, and challenges of the target users of technologies.
- Demonstrate proficiency in interpreting and synthesizing complex problems by identifying patterns in user research data, conducting competitor analysis, and concept testing.
- Develop design sketches, low-fidelity prototypes, and user storyboards to visualize design ideas and narratives of use in practical scenarios.
- Execute analytical evaluations (heuristic testing) and experimental evaluations (controlled studies) to gather feedback on user experiences effectively.
- Analyze user research data using thematic coding and statistical analyses.
- Apply commonly used descriptive and predictive models in HCI.
- Present findings from user research and evaluations in user experience reports and research papers.

## Evaluation Procedures and Grading Criteria


## Attendance Statement and Other Policies
You are allowed a maximum of two unexcused absences from the class except during sessions involving the two quizzes, exams, or when your group is presenting the project. Additional absences will result in a deduction of two points from your class participation grade. In the event you miss an exam or quiz due to an excused absence, you may have the chance to make up the missed assessment. Contact me to coordinate a suitable time, day, and method for the makeup exam or quiz.

In case of inclement weather-related closure or additional in-person instruction disruptions at Tulane, students should be ready to log in to a Zoom room at the scheduled class time for that day unless otherwise specified. Work will not be accepted beyond the due date. Assignments, Discussions, and Quizzes on Canvas, as well as any external submission links, will close at the time work is due. Assignments may not be re-submitted to improve a grade. I do not give extra credit.

Please acknowledge the use of any generative AI tools, including but not limited to ChatGPT and Bard, in your submissions at the end of the document.

For undergraduate students, a major component of your work for this course will be conducted as part of a team. With each major submission, students will be asked to submit an evaluation of the work of the members of their team. The questions in the evaluation will be shared in the class. It is important to resolve any conflicts within the group promptly. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me regarding any issues.

## ADA/Accessibility Statement
Tulane University is committed to offering classes that are accessible. If you anticipate or encounter disability-related barriers in a course, please contact the Goldman Center for Student Accessibility to establish reasonable accommodations. If approved by Goldman, make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion. I will never ask for medical documentation from you to support potential accommodation needs. Goldman Center contact information: Email: [goldman@tulane.edu](mailto:goldman@tulane.edu); Phone: (504) 862-8433; Website: [accessibility.tulane.edu](http://accessibility.tulane.edu)

## Code of Academic Conduct
The Code of Academic Conduct applies to all undergraduate students, full-time and part-time, in Tulane University. Tulane University expects and requires behavior compatible with its high standards of scholarship. By accepting admission to the university, a student accepts its regulations (i.e., Code of Academic Conduct and Code of Student Conduct) and acknowledges the right of the university to take disciplinary action, including suspension or expulsion, for conduct judged unsatisfactory or disruptive.

Unless I indicate differently on instructions, all assignments and exams are to be completed individually and without any study aid, including textbooks, class notes, or online sites. If you have any question about whether a resource is acceptable, you must ask the instructor rather than assume.

## Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Statement (EDI)
"Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) are important Tulane values that are key drivers of academic excellence in our learning environments. In our drive for academic excellence, we seek to ensure that students, faculty, and staff across diverse social identities, cultural backgrounds, and lived experiences can thrive - especially those from underrepresented and underserved communities (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, social class, international, veterans, religious minorities, age, and any other classification protected by applicable law - see Tulane's Nondiscrimination Policy). In order to build a supportive culture and climate for every member of our community, we recognize that we each have unique EDI strengths to share with others and that we also have areas for EDI growth, learning, and change. This EDI commitment and cultural humility help us collectively build a university community and culture where everyone experiences belonging."

## Religious Accommodation Policy
Per Tulane’s religious accommodation policy as stated at the bottom of Tulane’s academic calendar, I will make every reasonable effort to ensure that students are able to observe religious holidays without jeopardizing their ability to fulfill their academic obligations. Excused absences do not relieve the student from the responsibility for any coursework required during the period of absence. Students should notify me within the first two weeks of the semester about their intent to observe any holidays that fall on a class day or on the day of the final exam.

## Recordings of Class Sessions/Remote Engagement
Tutoring (Include as is)  
You can schedule a 1:1 tutoring appointment with a peer tutor at [Penji](https://web.penjiapp.com/schools/tulane). Select the ALTC Community.  
Writing Coaching: You can schedule an in-person or virtual writing consultation with one of our Writing Coaches at [Penji](https://web.penjiapp.com/schools/tulane). Select the Writing Center Community.  
To get the most out of your writing appointment:
- Bring all prompts, drafts, notes, and relevant research/support materials with you.
- When you receive your appointment confirmation email, reply and attach a copy of your paper for the Writing Coach to preview prior to your session.
- Have specific questions or areas that you want to work on.
- We recommend that students schedule at least 2 sessions for an average paper and 3 for a major assignment. 1 during the brainstorming and research collection stage, the 2nd after the first rough draft has been completed, and the 3rd prior to submitting the final draft.
- Good writing requires time and we strongly discourage last-minute appointments. If your paper is due at noon and you show up at 10:00 with a rough draft, there isn’t much we can do but commiserate with you on the poor grade you are going to receive.
- Writing resources for academic writing, presentations, and ESL tools can be found on our website here: [Writing Center](https://success.tulane.edu/altc/academic-writing-center)
- If you need help with research citations, writing software, or citation apps, the Howard-Tilton Memorial Library has a Research Help Desk and Subject Area Librarians to help you. They also offer workshops and presentations on a variety of topics and tools that support research and writing. You can access their resources and contact a Research Librarian here: [Tulane Library](https://library.tulane.edu/services)
