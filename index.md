Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a rapidly expanding field that has continuously transformed how we use computers over the past five decades. This course is designed for graduate students interested in understanding fundamental HCI theories, techniques, and research methods. Students will gain an overview of research methodologies in HCI, conduct literature reviews, and acquire hands-on experience with qualitative, survey, and experimental research methods. Throughout the semester, students will work on independent projects, applying the concepts and methods learned to practical HCI problems. Additionally, students will read and submit reflections on research papers on human-AI interaction, accessible computing, ubiquitous computing, and immersive technologies.
